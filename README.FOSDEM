FOSDEM runs a severely mangled version of Pentabarf.  Over the years,
we have pulled in many patches from many places and grown a lot of our
own changes.  Most of this happened under the influence of various
mind-expanding substances and without any meaningful revision control.

The purpose of this GitHub project is to try to merge our changes with
others' and maybe to become a source of truth for other conferences.
