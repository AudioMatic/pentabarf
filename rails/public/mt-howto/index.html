        <h1>FOSDEM Pentabarf Hotel HOWTO</h1>
        <p>
        This document will give you a short rundown of how to edit your details regarding
        travel reimbursements and hotel for FOSDEM.
        </p>

        <h1>Login</h1>
        <p>
        First of all, log in to <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org">penta.fosdem.org</a>.
        You should have received credentials to do so from the <a href="mailto:program@fosdem.org">program team</a>.
        If not, please contact them.
        </p>

        <h1>First screen</h1>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="00_login.jpg"/>
            <p>
            You will be presented with a first screen.<br/>
            There, please click on the <em>FOSDEM12</em> link.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="01_click_on_fosdem_link.jpg"/>
            <p>
            You will then be presented with the same screen as the one you used to submit
            your talk during the call for papers phase.<br/>
            There, please click on the <em>Person</em> button in the navigation bar on
            the left.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>

        <h1>Selecting the room type</h1>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="02_person.jpg"/>
            <p>
            When you select the <em>General</em> tab (on top of the window), you may not only
            edit your personal details (name, photo), but also select which type of room you
            would like us to provide you with, on the awkwardly named field <em>custom_conference_person::roomtype</em>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="03_person_roomtype.jpg"/>
            <p>
            Please do also leave the field <em>affiliation</em> empty.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h1>Travel details</h1>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="04_person_travel.jpg"/>
            <p>
            Next, please select the tab <em>Travel</em> on top of the window.
            </p>
            <p>
            You will then be presented with a large and somewhat confusing screen
            with a lot of data entry fields.
            </p>
            <p>
            For us, the most important ones when it comes to hotel reservation, are the following:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Date of arrival</em>: so we know from when on to make the reservation</li>
                <li><em>Date of departure</em>: unsurprisingly, for us to know when your hotel reservation ends</li>
                <li><em>Need accommodation?</em>: please tick this checkbox if you want us to provide you with a hotel room (at our expenses)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            Some of the other fields may also be filled out, as they will make the travel cost reimbursement
            process a lot easier, such as filling in your bank account information in the group of
            fields on the bottom of that screen (<em>IBAN</em>, <em>BIC</em>, <em>Name of bank</em> and <em>Account owner</em>).
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="05_accommodation.jpg"/>
            <p>
            In any case, and if you would like us to provide you with a hotel room during your stay
            in Brussels for the conference, please make sure to enable the <em>Need accommodation?</em>
            checkbox.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h1>Saving your changes</h1>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="save.jpg"/>
            <p>
            Last but not least, please also make sure to click the <em>Save</em> button that will
            have appeared on the bottom right corner of your browser window as soon as
            you have performed any change to the fields.
            </p>
