        <h1>FOSDEM Pentabarf HOWTO</h1>
        <p>
            This document will give you a short rundown of how to add speakers and sessions in Pentabarf
            for FOSDEM.
        </p>

        <h1>Login</h1>
        <p>
        First of all, log in to <a href="https://penta.fosdem.org">penta.fosdem.org</a>.
        You should have received credentials to do so from the <a href="mailto:devrooms@fosdem.org">devrooms team</a>.
        If not, please contact them.
        </p>

        <h1>First screen</h1>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/00_login.jpg"/>
            <p>
            You will be presented with a first screen that only contains information that is of importance
            to the core staff team.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/00_login_buttons.jpg"/>
            <p>
            The more important bits, for you, are to be found in the middle of the navigation bar on the left:
            <ul>
                <li>the first row of icons (with a looking glass) are for search</li>
                <li>the second row of icons (with a + sign) are for creating</li>
                <li>the first icon from the left is for <em>Person</em> instances, that is, speakers</li>
                <li>the icon in the middle is for <em>Event</em> instances, that is, talks</li>
                <li>the third icon is for <em>Conference</em>, something you do not have access to</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1>Adding a speaker</h1>
        <p>
        You should add speakers first, either all of them, or on a talk-by-talk basis, that is up to you.
        </p>
        <p>
        Later on, when you create Events, you can then assign Persons as speakers in those Events.
        The opposite does not work: while you can see which Events a Person is associated with in the
        Person screen, and navigate there, you cannot <em>assign</em> a Person as a speaker to an Event from
        the Person screen.
        </p>
        <p>
        Note that the database contains Persons who have been speakers in FOSDEM 2011 as well and, hence,
        please first search whether a Person already exists.
        </p>
        <h1>Searching for an existing speaker</h1>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/01_search.jpg"/>
            <p>
            The most convenient option is to use the search text box that is above the icons that have
            been presented above.
            </p>
            <p>
            Note that it searches for both Events and Persons.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you do find a match, click on the Person and edit data there instead of creating
            a new Person, but the screens to fill out will be exactly the same as explained below.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h1>Creating a new Person</h1>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/02_icon_person_new.jpg"/>
            <p>
            Click on the icon as depicted on the left to create a new Person.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/02_new_person.jpg"/>
            <p>
            This is the screen you will be presented with when creating a new Person.
            Note that Pentabarf, for some odd reason, keeps in mind which tab (on top) you have last selected, so
            you might end up in a different tab than "General". If that is the case, please click on the "General"
            tab first.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/03_person_general.jpg"/>
            <p>
            This is what the <em>General</em> section should look like once it is filled out.<br/>
            Please note that the relevant fields that must be filled out here are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>First Name</li>
                <li>Last Name</li>
            </ul>
            Everything else on this screen is optional.
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/04_person_image.jpg"/>
            <p>
            If the speaker provided a photo, you can upload it by clicking on the <em>Browse...</em> button next
            to the <em>Image</em> field, and specify the file there.
            <br/><br/>
            Note that the website expects the photos to be at the very least square, and ideally 128 x 128 pixels.
            You may need to use something like Gimp, Krita, or the likes, in order to cut out the head and resize
            accordingly.
            <br/><br/>
            We typically use <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-tutorial-quickie-crop.html">Gimp's Crop Tool</a>
            for that purpose.
            <br/><br/>
            It is also preferred to use the PNG format for images, although JPEG and GIF are supported as well.
            <br/><br/>
            <em><u><b>Important:</b></u></em> please do also enable the <em>Image public?</em> checkbox in order
            for that picture to be exported and visible on the website.
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/06_person_description_filled.jpg"/>
            <p>
            Then, click on the <em>Description</em> tab on top to enter the biography of the speaker and
            fill out the following fields:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Abstract</em> is mandatory and should contain a brief bio of the speaker</li>
                <li><em>Description</em> is optional and may contain additional information that did not fit
                into the <em>Abstract</em></li>
            </ul>
            Note that we do not include the speaker bios in the booklet for devroom speakers and, hence,
            it does not matter much whether you put everything into the <em>Abstract</em> or whether you split
            it up. The website displays <b>both</b>, first the <em>Abstract</em> and then the <em>Description</em>.
            <br/><br/>
            Typically, we usually put everything into the <em>Abstract</em> field <tt>;)</tt>
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/save.jpg"/>
            <p>
            Once you have clicked the <em>Save</em> button as it appears in the bottom right corner
            of your browser window as soon as you have changed anything, the photo will be uploaded
            (if applicable), the data be persisted, and the page be reloaded.
        </div>

        <h1>Adding a talk</h1>
        <p>
        Once a speaker (or all speakers) of a talk, or all speakers of all talks (as you prefer) have
        been created, you can now add their talks to the conferencing system.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/10_event_new.jpg"/>
            <p>
            You should do so by clicking the <em>new event</em> button on the left, and as depicted here.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/11_event_new_page.jpg"/>
            <p>
            You will then be presented with a blank entry for an <em>Event</em>.<br/>
            As for creating new <em>Person</em> instances, Pentabarf might open that page
            with a different tab than <em>General</em>. If that is the case, please click
            on the <em>General</em> tab above.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/12_event_general.jpg"/>
            <p>
            Data must be entered as follows:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Event title</em>: quite obviously, the title of the talk: please keep it rather short,
                as a long title will result in quite a few issues for displaying it on the schedule and the
                booklet (remember that we have 300 to 400 sessions to cram in there <tt>;)</tt>)</li>
                <li><em>Subtitle of the event</em>: is <b>not used</b> anywhere on the website nor the booklet,
                hence to be kept empty</li>
                <li><em>Slug</em>: will be used for the URL of the talk on the FOSDEM website; e.g. a slug <code>welcome_to_fosdem</code>
                will result in the URL of that talk to be <code>https://fosdem.org/2012/schedule/event/<b>welcome_to_fosdem</b></code><br/>
                For obvious reasons (readable URLs), please restrain to lower case ASCII here and use <code>_</code> (underline) to
                replace whitespaces (<code>welcome_to_fosdem</code> is definitely nicer than
                <code>Welcome%20to%20FOSDEM</code> in an URL)</li>
                <li>Event Origin</em>: does not matter for devrooms and is only for information purposes, so just leave it to
                its default value, <code>idea</code>, unless you want to keep track of that information yourself</li>
                <li><em>Event state</em>: <b>must</b> be set to <code>accepted</code> or it will not show up on the schedule</li>
                <li><em>Progress</em>: <b>must</b> be set to <code>reconfirmed</code> or it will not show up on the schedule</li>
                <li><em>Team</em>: not used, leave empty</li>
                <li><em>Submission of presentation slides</em>: not used either, leave to <code>unknown</code> unless you
                want to use it to keep track of that information yourself</li>
                <li><em>Track</em>: <b>must</b> be set to the name of your devroom, quite obviously<br/>
                Note that your devroom has been added to the list of tracks by the FOSDEM staff already. If that is not the case,
                please <a mailto="devrooms@fosdem.org">contact us</a>.
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/13_event_persons.jpg"/>
            <p>
            The next step here is to define the speaker(s) for that <em>Event</em>.<br/>
            To do that, please click on the <em>Persons</em> tab on top of the page.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/14_event_add_person_button.jpg"/>
            <p>
            Notice that your name has automatically been filled in as the <em>submitter</em>: you may very well
            leave that information there as it is, we don't use it anywhere on the website or on the booklet.
            <br/><br/>
            Click on the <em>Add person</em> button in order to add one or many people with the role
            of <em>speaker</em> to the <em>Event</em>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/15_event_add_person_box.jpg"/>
            <p>
            After clicking the <em>Add person</em> button, an additional row has been added to the list
            of <em>Person</em>s.<br/>
            If you wish to add several speakers to an <em>Event</em>, you may of course repeat that operation
            at will. Every <em>Person</em> with the <em>Event role</em> set to <em>speaker</em> will appear
            on the schedule (website and booklet).
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/16_event_add_person_speaker.jpg"/>
            <p>
            As depicted on the left, make sure to select <em>speaker</em> as the role of the <em>Person</em>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/17_event_add_person_confirmed.jpg"/>
            <p>
            Once you have selected <code>speaker</code> as the <em>Event role</em>, an additional selection list
            will appear on its right, for <em>Role state</em>.<br/>
            That field <b>must</b> be set to <code>confirmed</code> in order for the talk to show up in
            the schedule.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/18_event_description.jpg"/>
            <p>
            The next step is to click on the <em>Description</em> tab in order to fill out the abstract of the
            talk.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/19_event_description_filled.jpg"/>
            <p>
            The following fields must be filled out:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Abstract</em>: is mandatory; please keep it somewhat shorter as it is the part that will
                be included in the booklet</li>
                <li><em>Description</em>: is optional and may be used as an overflow if the abstract of the talk
                is somewhat longer</li>
            </ul>
            The rationale here is that the <em>Abstract</em> shows up both in the booklet and on the website,
            but the <em>Description</em> is only displayed on the website.<br/>
            Note that on the website, both are displayed, the <em>Abstract</em> first, and the <em>Description</em>
            right below, so do not repeat the content of the <em>Abstract</em> in the <em>Description</em> field.
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/21_event_schedule_filled.jpg"/>
            <p>
            The last step is to specify the schedule information for that talk. In order to do so,
            please click the <em>Schedule</em> tab on top of the window.<br/>
            <br/>
            Fill out all fields as follows:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Day</em>: select <code>Saturday</code> or <code>Sunday</code>, accordingly to
                when your devroom has been planned (as you have been informed of by the devrooms team) or,
                if your devroom spans both days, as you have chosen to put it on your schedule</li>
                <li><em>Start time</em>: self-explanatory</li>
                <li><em>Duration</em>: self-explanatory</li>
                <li><em>Room</em>: please select the room that has been assigned to your devroom, as you
                have been informed of by the devrooms team</li>
                <li><em>Public event</em>: <b>must</b> be enabled to show up on the schedule</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div class="i">
            <img src="images/howto/save.jpg"/>
            <p>
            As the last step, press the <em>Save</em> button in the lower right corner of your browser
            window to persist the changes.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1>Exporting</h1>
        <p>
        Changing data in Pentabarf does not result in a change of the schedule on the fosdem.org website.<br/>
        The reason is that we use an export process in between the two in order to integrate the
        scheduling information from Pentabarf properly into our website.<br/>
        <br/>
        Triggering an export is something that only the devrooms team can do and, hence, once you have entered
        speakers and talks and would like that information to be put on our website, please contact us
        at <a href="mailto:devrooms@fosdem.org">devrooms@fosdem.org</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Note that if your schedule is still in flux, you may want to make sure that your <em>Event</em>s
        are set to <code>unconfirmed</code> until it is final, or else it will be on our website once we
        trigger the export (e.g. upon request by another devroom).
        </p>
